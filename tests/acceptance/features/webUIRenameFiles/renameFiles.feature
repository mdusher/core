  So that I can organise my data structure

  Background:

  Scenario Outline: Rename a file using special characters
    Given user "user1" has uploaded file with content "some content" to "/randomfile.txt"
    And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user renames file "randomfile.txt" to <to_file_name> using the webUI
    Then file <to_file_name> should be listed on the webUI
    When the user reloads the current page of the webUI
    Then file <to_file_name> should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | to_file_name           |
      | 'लोरेम।तयक्स्त? $%#&@' |
      | '"quotes1"'            |
      | "'quotes2'"            |

    When the user reloads the current page of the webUI
    Then file <to_name> should be listed on the webUI
    And the content of file <to_name> for user "user1" should be "some content"
    Examples:
